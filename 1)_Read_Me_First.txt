Here i have created some sample files and in order to learn git.
The files you create in this repository try to name them without giving spaces between them
and we are going to make this directory a git directory, 
to make git directory we will open 'Git Bash' here and use command 'git init', then it will become a git repository.
Remeber it is recommended to check either your directory's status before making it git like 'git status' if your desired
direcortory is already a git directory then it will cause some problems.
